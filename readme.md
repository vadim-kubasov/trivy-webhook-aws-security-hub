# Trivy Webhook AWS Security Hub

This application processes vulnerability reports from Trivy, a vulnerability scanning tool for containers, and imports the findings into AWS Security Hub. It acts as a webhook receiver that listens for vulnerability reports sent by Trivy and processes them before forwarding the results to AWS Security Hub.

## Features

- Receives vulnerability reports via an HTTP POST request.
- Supports importing CVE findings into AWS Security Hub.
- Designed for integration with container image scanning.
- Logs and reports errors for easier troubleshooting.

## How It Works

1. **Vulnerability Report**: The application listens for incoming vulnerability reports in JSON format from Trivy via a `/trivy-webhook` endpoint.
2. **Validation**: The incoming report is validated to ensure it's of type `VulnerabilityReport`, and only then are the vulnerabilities processed.
3. **AWS Security Hub Integration**: Vulnerabilities are imported as security findings into AWS Security Hub.
4. **Health Check**: The `/healthz` endpoint provides a simple health check for the application.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: This application uses AWS Security Hub to store and manage security findings, so you must have an active AWS account and the necessary permissions.
- **Trivy**: You must set up Trivy to scan container images and send reports to the webhook endpoint.
- **Go**: The application is written in Go, so you'll need Go installed to build and run it.
  
## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csepulveda/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub.git
   cd trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
   ```

2. **Build the application**:

   Make sure Go is installed and set up correctly:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go build -o trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   You can start the application locally:

   ```bash
   ./trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port `8080`.

4. **Set up Trivy**:

   Configure Trivy to send vulnerability reports to the `/trivy-webhook` endpoint of the running application.

   Example Trivy command:

   ```bash
   trivy image --format json --output result.json <image>
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @result.json http://localhost:8080/trivy-webhook
   ```

## Environment Variables

You can configure AWS credentials using standard AWS environment variables or by setting up the AWS SDK on your local machine or server.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

These are automatically loaded by the AWS SDK for Go.

## API Endpoints

- **POST** `/trivy-webhook`: Receives vulnerability reports in JSON format. Only processes reports of type `VulnerabilityReport` and imports CVE findings to AWS Security Hub.
- **GET** `/healthz`: Health check endpoint that returns a simple `OK` response.

## Example Vulnerability Report (from Trivy)

```json
{
  "kind": "VulnerabilityReport",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example",
    "labels": {
      "trivy-operator.container.name": "example-container"
    }
  },
  "report": {
    "registry": {
      "server": "docker.io"
    },
    "artifact": {
      "repository": "library/nginx",
      "digest": "sha256:exampledigest"
    },
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "vulnerabilityID": "CVE-2021-12345",
        "title": "Example Vulnerability",
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "resource": "nginx",
        "installedVersion": "1.18.0",
        "fixedVersion": "1.19.0",
        "primaryLink": "https://example.com/CVE-2021-12345"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
