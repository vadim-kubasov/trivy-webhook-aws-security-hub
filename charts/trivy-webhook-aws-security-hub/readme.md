# Trivy Webhook for AWS Security Hub

This application integrates [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), a popular container vulnerability scanning tool, with [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/). It acts as a webhook receiver that listens for vulnerability reports sent by Trivy and imports the findings into AWS Security Hub, enabling centralized vulnerability management for container images in your AWS environment.

## Features
- **Webhook Receiver**: Accepts vulnerability reports in JSON format from Trivy.
- **AWS Security Hub Integration**: Automatically imports container vulnerabilities as findings into AWS Security Hub.
- **Seamless Kubernetes Integration**: Works with the Trivy Operator in Kubernetes for automated vulnerability scans.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with [Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) enabled.
- Kubernetes cluster with [Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) installed.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed for deployment.
- IAM role created with access to AWS Security Hub or set the AWS env Variables.

## How to Install
Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub https://csepulveda.github.io/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub/
```

Install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install trivy-webhook trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub \
  --set serviceAccount.annotations."eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn"="arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub-role"
```

- Replace `arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub-role` with your actual IAM role ARN.
- The IAM role should have permissions to write findings into AWS Security Hub.

### Explanation:
- The `serviceAccount.annotations` sets the necessary IAM role for the service to access AWS resources securely.
- By specifying `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`, the Trivy webhook can assume the specified IAM role and import vulnerability findings into Security Hub.

## Setting Up Trivy Operator

To send vulnerability reports from the Trivy Operator to the webhook, configure the following setting in the `trivy-operator` Helm chart:

```bash
--set operator.webhookBroadcastURL=http://<service-name>.<namespace>/trivy-webhook
```

Example:

```bash
--set operator.webhookBroadcastURL=http://trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub.default/trivy-webhook
```

This ensures that the Trivy Operator sends its scan results to the Trivy webhook, which will then process and forward them to AWS Security Hub.

## How It Works

1. **Trivy Scan**: Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities.
2. **Webhook**: The Trivy Operator sends the scan report to the Trivy Webhook via the `/trivy-webhook` endpoint.
3. **AWS Security Hub**: The webhook processes the report and imports the findings into AWS Security Hub, enabling centralized vulnerability management.

## Customization

You can customize various parameters of the Helm chart, such as:
- **ServiceAccount annotations** for IAM role-based access.
- **Replicas** to scale the webhook deployment.
- **Resource requests and limits** for container sizing.

For a full list of configurable values, refer to the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart.
